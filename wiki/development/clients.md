# Desert Clients

| ⚠️ Current wiki describes the vision

## React Native

Expo SDK52 to bring:
- New devtools
- edge-to-edge
- Over the air updates
- Treeshaking
- Light/dark splash screens
- React 19 compiler
- React DOM ("use dom")

## Design library

Visit [design](design.md) to learn more our design system

Libraries like [react-native-reusables](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/react-native-reusables) are great, but tailwind is another layer of abstraction!

So, we build own [component library](https://www.figma.com/design/qoIXEjDuf7cdCjGIYUHeMT/Desert?node-id=0-1), that meets the needs of our project
